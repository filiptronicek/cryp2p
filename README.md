This project is a part of the [Solana Riptide](https://solana.com/riptide) hackathon, but was actually never submitted :)

You can check it out at https://cryp2p.on.fleek.co/.

## Is it any good?

It depends on what you want to do. The project's intended purpose is to make payments easier on the Solana blockchain and to remove sharing addresses from the process. Currently, that is achieved via two different ways:
1. NFC - you can scan NFC tags with SOL addresses to send money easily
2. QR Codes - you can scan and show QR codes for your address and send transactions right away

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
